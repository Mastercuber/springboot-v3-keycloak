# Spring Boot v3 Keycloak Integration
See [this](https://github.com/Yasas4D/springboot-v3-keycloak/tree/main) repo!  
The Repo has been reworked a bit and tested with Keycloak Version 21.0.2. A keystore with a private key has been used to support TLS 1.3. Also a truststore is provided. For your testing, these two stores need to been generated by yourself; also the keycloak server must be installed somewhere and accessible.

## Get setup
To test the project (assumed a keycloak instance is already running and configured with TLS), first, generate the CA Cert and TLS Cert with `chmod u+x generate-stores.sh && ./generate-stores.sh`.  
Then modify `application.yml` (`localhost`) to fit your hostname.

Put the `keystore.p12` and `truststore.p12` in the `src/main/resources/` directory and start the Application. 

### Endpoints

```
[GET] http://localhost:8081/api/test/anonymous
```

```
