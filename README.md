# Spring Boot v3 Keycloak Integration
See [this](https://github.com/Yasas4D/springboot-v3-keycloak/tree/main) repo!  
The Repo has been reworked a bit and tested with Keycloak Version 21.0.2. A keystore with a private key has been used to support TLS 1.3. Also a truststore is provided. For your testing, these two stores need to been generated by yourself; also the keycloak server must be installed somewhere and accessible.
